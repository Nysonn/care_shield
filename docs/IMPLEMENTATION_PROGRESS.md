  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_pharmacy_system
  npm run seed:pharmacies
  ```

- [ ] **Update MedsScreen** - Change navigation to pharmacies first
- [ ] **Update CheckoutScreen** - Include pharmacy info, drugs, and services
- [ ] **Update OrdersHistoryScreen** - Display pharmacy in order history

- [ ] **ServiceCard** widget (for displaying services)
- [ ] Update **ProductCard** widget (if needed)

### Testing
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Test pharmacy listing and pagination
- [ ] Test order placement with pharmacy
- [ ] Test complete user flow

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP NEXT ACTIONS

### 1. Database Migration (CRITICAL - Do First)
```bash
# In terminal, navigate to backend
cd /home/nyson/StudioProjects/care_shield/backend

# Run the migration (creates all new tables)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_pharmacy_system

# Seed pharmacies and services
npm run seed:pharmacies
```

**This will:**
- Create all new tables (Pharmacy, Service, etc.)
- Archive existing orders
- Create 10 Mbarara pharmacies
- Create 8 services
- Link ~20 drugs to all pharmacies
- Link services to all pharmacies

### 2. Create PharmacyDetailsScreen
**File:** `lib/features/meds/screens/pharmacy_details_screen.dart`

**Features needed:**
- Display pharmacy name and address prominently
- Tab view: "Drugs" and "Services"
- Drugs tab: List PharmacyDrug items with prices
- Services tab: List PharmacyService items with prices
- Add to cart functionality (drugs and services)
- Search within drugs
- Navigate to checkout

**Key UI elements:**
```dart
- Pharmacy header card
- TabBar (Drugs / Services)
- ListView for drugs
- ListView for services
- FloatingActionButton for checkout/cart
```

### 3. Update MedsScreen Navigation
**File:** `lib/features/meds/screens/meds_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Line ~280: Update "Browse Products" action
- Change navigation from `MedOrderScreen` to `PharmaciesScreen`
- Update header text from "Products" to "Pharmacies & Products"
- Keep "Order Refill" but navigate to pharmacies list

**Code snippet:**
```dart
_buildActionCard(
  title: 'Browse Pharmacies',
  subtitle: 'Explore pharmacies and their products',
  icon: Icons.local_pharmacy,
  color: AppColors.secondaryGreen,
  onTap: () => Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => PharmaciesScreen()),
  ),
),
```

### 4. Update Checkout Flow
**File:** `lib/features/meds/screens/checkout_screen.dart`

**Changes needed:**
- Add pharmacy information at top
- Separate sections for drugs and services
- Calculate totals: drugs + services + delivery
- Update API call to include:
  - pharmacyId
  - drugs array (with drugId and pharmacyDrugId)
  - services array (with serviceId, pharmacyServiceId, quantity)

### 5. Update Order History
**File:** `lib/features/meds/screens/orders_history_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Display pharmacy name in each order card
- Show both drugs and services in order details
- Handle null pharmacy (for archived orders)

### 6. Test Complete Flow
- [ ] Open app
- [ ] Navigate to Meds/Products
- [ ] Browse pharmacies
- [ ] Select a pharmacy
- [ ] View drugs and services
- [ ] Add items to cart
- [ ] Proceed to checkout
- [ ] Place order
- [ ] View order in history

# Run migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_pharmacy_system

# Seed data
npm run seed:pharmacies

# Start server
npm run dev
```

### Frontend:

## üîë KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

1. **Database Migration First**: Must run migration before backend will work
2. **One Pharmacy Per Order**: Users select one pharmacy and order from it
3. **Archived Orders**: Old orders are archived, not deleted (data preserved)
4. **Free Market Pricing**: Each pharmacy sets its own prices
5. **Services in Orders**: Users can order both drugs and services together
6. **Mbarara Focus**: System optimized for Mbarara District only
7. **No Admin Portal**: All management done manually (out of scope)

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If backend doesn't start:
1. Check database connection in `.env`
2. Ensure migration ran successfully
3. Run `npm run build` to recompile TypeScript

### If Flutter has errors:
1. Run `flutter pub get`
2. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Check import paths are correct

### If no pharmacies show:
1. Ensure backend is running
2. Check seed script ran successfully
3. Verify API base URL in Flutter app

## üìù DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NEEDED

Once implementation is complete:
- [ ] Update README.md with pharmacy features
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with version changes
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add screenshots of new screens
- [ ] Update PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md

---

**Next Immediate Action:** Run database migration and seed script (see Step 1 above)

**Estimated Time to Complete Remaining Tasks:** 8-12 hours
- PharmacyDetailsScreen: 3-4 hours
- Screen updates: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 1-2 hours
